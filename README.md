# Higgs ANN classifier
A work in progress neural network suite for classifying Higgs sector events in particle collision data. This is very much a work in progress (I'm 2 months into to a year long project).

Files:
- `nn.py` contains the logic to handle run and train a neural network.
- `analysenn.py` handles preprocessing of data, and can train and compare many networks by importing `nn.py`.
- `results.pdf` contains some ROC curves and histograms showing that the code actually works!
